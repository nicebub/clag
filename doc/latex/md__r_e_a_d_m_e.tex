Sclex follows the same specifications that {\itshape {\bfseries{lex}}} and $\ast$$\ast$\+G\+NU {\itshape flex$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ follow, $\ast$except} for what hasn\textquotesingle{}t been implemented {\itshape yet}.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{Background}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}
I wrote Sclex as my first project to get back into programming after {\bfseries{15}} {\itshape years}. I am currently adding documentation after having rushed to complete it before my other job started. Now I am currently motivated to work on this program again. I hope to turn this experiment and learning-\/to-\/code-\/again experience into something understandable and useful.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{Internal Features}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}

In the right column are examples or symbols that represent what can be written as a regular expression. The regular expressions are used to to tell the lexer how to match patterns of the input.
